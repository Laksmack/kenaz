# Version Bumping Rule

After every code change (bug fix, feature, refactor, or any modification to source files), bump the patch version in `package.json` before building.

- Use semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Fixes and small changes: bump PATCH (e.g. 0.3.0 → 0.3.1)
- New features: bump MINOR (e.g. 0.3.1 → 0.4.0)
- Breaking changes: bump MAJOR
- Always bump before running `npm run dist` or `npm run build`
- The version in `package.json` is the single source of truth
